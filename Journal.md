## June 25th/26th: Github Setup and CAD for Triple Z (5 hours) Went through midnight

In this session, I just worked on cad for the triple z and brainstormed ideas some for how to do the main project. I incorperated a 3rd z motor at the back of the printer, and added 2 additional rods alonside. I also designed a whole new bed mount most of the way, still need to add connectors and such.

All the new models I made during this session(obviusly stepper and leadscrew were preexisting)

## June 27th: Finished CAD for Triple Z (2 hours)

In this session I finished the CAD for the triple z and quad rod design, I redesigned the joining system for the bed frame parts and designed in the rod clamps and heatsink holes and stuff like that. Then I added the final touches like adding bearings and leadscrew nuts to the design. I also reorganized the file management some to make it easier to work with.(naming stuff properly, grouping things, etc). I'm still trying to work out how exactly I want to do the bedslinger thing, if I should try to have it clamp to the bed somehow or screw into the bed frame. Maybe I'll design options for both.

New bed joining system - heat inserts go in inside forks, then screws clamp down through forks to each other from the outside

Probably finished design
