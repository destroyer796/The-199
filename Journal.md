June 26th: Started on CAD

In this session, I just worked on cad for the triple z and brainstormed ideas some for how to do the main project. I incorperated a 3rd z motor at the back of the printer, and added 2 additional rods alonside. I also designed a whole new bed mount most of the way, still need to add connectors and such.
